10.3

The project now has most of it's classes. A lot of changes happened. Compared to first week, some functions have been made in an easier way. 
I also made mistakes when planning this project and so some methods were made again from scracth, nonetheless are still working, except for point counting. While there are tests,
they are old and do not predict the real outcome we want. That is again because of me not reading fully the instructions. But classes Weight, Mass, Place and Scale work in the 
intended way, minus one method in Scale.

Most of the things I did were done in the first week betewwn 24.2 - 1.3 and I used around 3 hours a day. The second week didn't go as planned because of hurry,
but luckily that didn't really affect my schedule. I hope to finish the point counting before weekend so I can start working on the GUI as I believe it will be the most difficult part.
